      Magic missile can crack open any "lock", simply cast wiz.magic_missile
      Remember to always carry some WC with you when casting magic missile, as you need to charge the wand with one to cast it

      Crack open multiple T1 targets with a single spell cast. This spell will cost you 2WC (if there where any "locks" on the targets)
      It can be cast again with the same targets, if it couldn't finish them in the first run, and will continue where it ended.
